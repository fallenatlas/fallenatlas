### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tiago Antunes, currently a 3rd year student of Computer Science and Enginnering at Instituto Superior Tecnico in Lsbon, Portugal

My main area of interest is game development. I've worked on some small prototypes in Unity in the past and I'm currently making my first playable game as I learn Godot. My focus is to keep working on games and learning more about game production and game engines.

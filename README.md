### Hi there 👋

### :man_technologist: About Me :

I'm Tiago Antunes, currently I'm doing my Master's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering Student at Instituto Superior Técnico, Lisbon. I am specializing in Videogames and Interaction and Visualization, and aim to land a job in the game industry as a programmer for games.

- 🎮 I enjoy doing game jams, and game with longer development time. I also like doing small projects to experiment with novel game mechanics, that mostly never see the day light.

- 🎲 I'm contributing to a student made Game Engine, Cubos, primarily building it's physics from the ground up.

- 📸 I like pretty things. I love photography and design, and the little details. I love to play games. And perhaps above all, I like speed.

- 🗣️ Always free to talk, if you have any question or you'd like to work with me, feel free to contact me!
